## Versioning Common Codebase Project / Versioning Coding Cooperation Project Introduction
Document versioning are highly expected but seems no solution at the moment. Also, current existing document processors have straight behavior, such as auto creating style which make characters disappeared, saving whole document for each save, lagging for large document, etc. Unfortunately, seems that those behaviors are not bug. Enhancement cannot be expected. So, Versioning Coding Cooperation Project is introducted to develop a document versioning system.

In order to implement versioning document program, document processor and git manager are need to be implemented at the same time. To speed up, a generator is required to manage those projects. So, there are totally 3 programs need to be written at the same times.

When starting a new project, it is time consuming to create basic structure. And rewrite codebase is time consuming. In fact, all projects have similar structure and lots of similar functions. Versioning Common Codebase Project is raised to extract common factor to enhance development efficience.

## Versioning Common Codebase Project Members
VCC Module is a combination of Interface + C++ DLL. Most process are included in C++ DLL to minimize effort for cross-platform.
At the moment, only consider to support Java UI (Window, Linux and Android) and Swift UI (Mac OS and iOS).

    Target workspace. If not state, then current workspace.

-plugins <plugins>
    Can state multiple times. It is the same as the list in vcc.json.

--ExcludeUnitTest
    Exclude gtest.

--ExcludeExternalUnitTest
    Exclude VCC unitest. If full trust VCC git source, then can skip to speed up. If need to customize, recommand to keep it.

Description:
    Generate project from template.

### Command - Update
vpg -Update [-workspace-destination <workspace-destination>]workspace

-workspace-destination <workspace-destination>
    Target workspace. If not state, then current workspace.

Description:
    Only for VCC Module. Other properties are overriden by vcc.json.
    First update template to the version that same as VCCProjectGenerator. Then compare different and update the files in workspace. Details: vcc.json, Update Rule.

### Command - Generate
vpg -Generate [-workspace-destination <workspace-destination>]workspace

Description:
    Only for VCC Module. Other properties are overriden by vcc.json. Details: vcc.json, Generate Rule.

### vcc.json
For VCCModule, there is vcc.json. Update Mode and Generate Mode fully depends on vcc.json. Can include this to .gitignore file.

#### Properies
Version
    Current VCCModule Version. Please manaully update while manually update Project from git source.

ProjectType
    VCCModule. Reserve for other project type, such as Java and Swift.

WorkspaceSourceGitUrl
    Git source.

WorkspaceDestination
    Current workspace. Just for referece.

ProjectPrefix
    In generation mode, generator only read file with that prefix and generate class with that prefix. It is used to distinguish different project if having multi dll.
    E.g. "ProjectPrefix": "VPG"
    Generator only read file have prefix vpg_* and generate class as VPGObject

ProjectName
    Project name.

ProjectNameDll
    DLL name. If does not compile dll, keep it empty. Will auto update Makefile and related files (Enhancement in next version).

ProjectNameExe
    EXE name. If does not compile exe, keep it empty. Will auto update Makefile and related files (Enhancement in next version).

ProjectNameGtest
    gtest folder name. Although can have rename to the other name, but keep it unittest is advise. If does not compile unittest, keep it empty. Will auto update Makefile and related files (Enhancement in next version).

IsGit
    If true, then generate .gitignore.

IsExcludeVCCUnitTest
    If true, then skip update unittest/External/VCC/

TypeWorkspace
    In Generation mode, generator will search file with suffix *_property.hpp to create Class, Property Accessor etc. Detail: Generation Rule.

ActionTypeDirectory, ExceptionTypeDirectory, ManagerTypeDirectory, ObjectTypeDirectory
    The location to export action_type.hpp, exception_type.hpp, manager_type.hpp, object_type.hpp
    All are used to export to interface. Cannot delete those files. action_type may be moved to External/VCC/Form/Action/ in the future such that action can be optional.

ModelDirectory
    In Generation mode, class files are generated here.

PropertyAccessorDirectoryHpp
    In Generation mode, property accessor hpp files are generated here. Not support in current version.

PropertyAccessorDirectoryCpp
    In Generation mode, property accessor cpp files are generated here. Not support in current version.

Plugins
    In Update mode, generator will copy folders under include/External, src/External, unittest/External to workspace.
    Option:
        VCC/Versioning/Git

### Update Rule
Procedure:
1. Download template.
2. Switch to corresponnding tag.
3. Synchronize files under External/VCC/Core and folder specified under Plugins in vcc.json
4. If file does not exist in workspace, then add files.
5. If file does not exist in template, then delete files.
6. If file both exists in workspace and template but not the same, then update files with following rules. (Samples in vpg_file_sync_service_test.cpp)
    6.1 Check file of workspace has following line at line 1.
        ```
        // <vcc:vccproj sync="FULL"/>
        ```
        Value of sync:
            FULL: Follow tag in file content.
            DEMAND: Replace all file content except tag has marked RESERVE.
            SKIP: No update.
            FORCE: Replace everything.

        Note: By default it is FULL mode.
        Note: current version only support sync only. Will add generation tag letter.

    6.2 In file content, if inherited project file and current project file both has that tag with same name, generateor will update with following rules.
        Inherited Project: 
            ```
            // <vcc:tagA sync="RESERVE">
            Code A
            // </vcc:tagA>
            ```

        Current Project: 
            // <vcc:tagA sync="REPLACE">
            Code B
            // </vcc:tagA>

        In the example, Inherited Project file and Current Project file both have tag with tagA. Then generator will update the code with following rules.
        Value of sync:
            RESERVE: No update.
            REPLACE: Replace current project file content by inherited project.
            ALERT: Show different it there is change. Not support at the moment.

### Generate Rule
The final objective is that user only need to handle enum class like sql table and logic in service and manager only. Other thing will be auto generate.
Sample in vpg_file_generation_manager_test.cpp

Definition of Program Structure
    Class: C++ Class. Data storage.
    Structure: C++ Structure. Used to support huge data process. Not support at the moment.
    PropertyAccessor: Bridge between Control and model. Provide thread safe access, validation, trigger etc. Not support at the moment.
    Service: Class with static function only. It is used to provide logic.
    Manager: Class with model. Call service to modify model.
    Form: Class with Manager. Call Manager to do action.

Definition of Enum Class
    Class Property file: file name with format projectPrefix_objectName_property.hpp
        If project prefix is defined in vcc.json, then all files and classes that not having project prefix will be skipped.
    Enum Class file: file name with format projectPrefix_enumName.hpp;
        If project prefix is defined in vcc.json, then all files and classes that not having project prefix will be skipped.
        All enum that used in class must be defined in TypeWorkspace. Otherwise will have compile error.


Restriction
- Field names should be long form and capital letter.
- Field names should having component with descending order. E.g. WorkspaceSource instead of SourceWorkspace
- All fields should use macro in class_macro.hpp.
- Not allow to use using namespace std, there are so many bugs. If want to use std library, please use std::wstring etc. Now only support <string>, will enhance to support all system type  
- Does not allow ClassA contains ClassB and ClassB contains ClassA. As there is Clone method in Macro which is not trivial.

Procedure
    1. Read all files in TypeWorkspace.
    2. For all Class Property file, will generate Class file etc.
    3. All Enum Class File will export to interface like java etc. (Not implement yet)

Example
    In vpg_object_property.hpp,
    
    ```
    #pragma once

    enum class VPGObjectProperty
    {
        EnumA, // Nothing
        EnumB, // GETSET(std::wstring, EnumB, "Default")
        EnumC, // GET(int64_t, EnumC, 0)
        EnumD, // GETSET(VPGEnumClass, EnumD, VPGEnumClass::OptionA)
        EnumE  // VECTOR(VPGEnumClass, EnumE)
    };
    ```

    In vpg_enum_class.hpp,
    ```
    #pragma once

    enum class VPGEnumClass
    {
        OptionA,
        OptionB,
        OptionC,
        OptionD
    };
    ```

    It will generate class file vpg_object.hpp with following content

    ```
    #pragma once

    #include <string>

    #include "base_object.hpp"
    #include "class_macro.hpp"
    #include "object_type.hpp"

    #include "vpg_enum_class.hpp"

    class VCCObject : public BaseObject<VCCObject>
    {
        GETSET(std::wstring, EnumB, L\"Default\")
        GET(int64_t, EnumC, 0)
        GETSET(VPGEnumClass, EnumD, VPGEnumClass::OptionA)
        VECTOR(EnumClass, EnumE)

        public:
            VCCObject() : BaseObject(ObjectType::Object) {}
            virtual ~VCCObject() {}
    };
    ```

## History
The project is start from 2022-06-22. As Document Versioning is needed but no solution can be found. Also, existing document processors have some interesting behaviour, such as

When save, will save from beginning.
Auto create new style which will make charactors hiden.
When press Enter at Title, the new line will have new style that make the content disappear.
When having outline then save, document cannot save correctly.
The Index cannot recognize item number. When save, item numbers disappear.
When handling thousand pages document, it lags. Some will hang and quit.
Docx cannot save as docx by default.
Cannot save in local storage by default.
Security Problem. etc.

As those problems have not been solve until 2022-06-22, I believe that they are properties instead of bugs. I better to write a document processor myself. When I try to write a document processor with versioning, I find that I should write a git application instead of document processor. But I need to write a document processor before creating a git application project. As most codes are mechanical work, I write a code generator to write those projects instead of writing one by one. So, I need to write 3 applications.

Firstly, I try to use SwiftUI + dynamic library first as I don’t need to create website and handle payment progess. But I can find no way to create virtual ListView.
Secondly, as SwiftUI seems difficult to me, I try to use C# + dynamic library as I am experienced in C#. But I found that Linux and MacOS does not support C# and Visual Studio does not support multi-platform, then I give up.
Thirdly, I try to use Java + dynamic library as Java is multiplatform. But I find that NetBeans has not supported C++ long time ago. 
Finally, I try to use VSCode with g++. Then I try about one month to setup the makefile. In fact, there are no templates for multiplatform with gtest. I need to study and write makefiles (both library and executable) from the beginning. In fact, I have used about 6 months to investigate. I think I better write a program to skip one year effort.

In fact, the first release is 2024-05-05, I have used one and a half year (although I can only write the code at weekend and after work) to write basic structure, which is not complete yet.

Hope everyone can skip at least 2 years effort and dont need to ask same question again and again.

## How to Contribute
It is my first git opensource project. In fact, I don't know what to do.
